          Brier Creek Pecan Orchard Wraps Up AcreTraderâ€™s Successful September
        </h3>

          Rolling Fork Timber Tract is a 3,209 acre property in Sevier County,
          Arkansas with mature hardwoods and well diversified age classes of
          planted pines. This tract is an opportunity to invest in a large,
          professionally managed forest whose size and diversity of tree species
          and age classes may provide investors with early harvest and cash flow
          potential. Consisting of 91% productive timberland, this property has
          approximately 1,183 acres of planted pine of various ages as well as
          1,730 acres of mature hardwoods of multiple species. This diversity of
          species and age classes offers the opportunity for harvest activity in
          multiple years of the hold period, and thus anticipated cash flow for
          investors. Rolling Fork Timber Tract has direct access to U.S. Highway
          70 and boasts an interior road system in good condition. It has
          received significant capital improvements in the past year undertaken
          by the present owner, including construction of a new main road and
          two new bridges. This property has historically been professionally
          managed by an established local forestry company with a large
          management footprint and institutional-grade data and inventory
          tracking. We expect to continue working with the current management
          company to maintain continuity and leverage local expertise. Rolling
          Fork Timber Tract lies in a strong wood basket with extensive mill
          infrastructure. The second largest softwood mill in the southern U.S.
          is located in the nearby town of Dierks, about 30 miles from the
          property, with additional nearby mill options for timber delivery. In
          addition, the Rolling Fork Little River flows through this property,
          supporting wildlife populations and enhancing recreational value. A
          timber tract of this size brings several potential investment
          benefits. Firstly, it allows for frequency and optionality of harvest
          activity and the ability to respond to trends in both softwood and
          hardwood markets. Additionally, ongoing management activities
          associated with regular thinning helps maintain and build long term
          value as an investable timber property. There is also flexibility and
          risk diversification with respect to exit strategy. A large tract like
          this one could ultimately be divided and sold in smaller parcels into
          the timber or recreational market. Alternatively, an aggregation
          strategy in which this tract is combined with another AcreTrader
          timber property in neighboring Howard County could prove marketable to
          institutional buyers.
